## Core Operating Contract
- Treat this repository as the source of truth.
- Treat the website as a rendered view of repository state.
- Prefer small, additive, traceable edits.
- Keep documentation synchronized with code and project structure.
- Keep the repository minimalist by default.

## Default Workflow
- Inspect repository structure before editing.
- Make the smallest diff that solves the request.
- Update related docs when behavior, workflows, or outputs change.
- Update changelog, dev log, or equivalent history files for meaningful changes.
- Preserve existing structure and historical context.
- Do not perform destructive rewrites unless explicitly requested.

## Documentation and Website Policy
- Treat `docs/` as project-level documentation and website source.
- Update docs whenever code, workflows, or outputs change.
- Amend existing docs when possible; do not replace whole files without need.
- Preserve navigation, readability, and consistency in website changes.
- Keep default website behavior clean and minimal unless the user asks for more expressive design.

## Testing Policy
- Assume `tests/` may exist before a full testing framework is defined.
- Do not invent domain-specific tests when expected behavior is unclear.
- Add the smallest meaningful tests when behavior is known.
- Prefer early-stage checks such as smoke tests, import tests, CLI tests, schema checks, or example-based checks.
- If tests are deferred, document the gap; do not imply coverage that does not exist.

## Package and Structure Separation Policy
- Keep website structure and package structure clearly separated.
- Do not automatically repurpose `docs/` for package-native docs or build artifacts.
- For Python packaging requests, prefer standard Python layout, typically `src/`.
- For R packaging requests, follow standard R conventions (`R/`, `man/`, `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, optional `vignettes/`).
- For other ecosystems, follow ecosystem conventions.
- If structural conflicts arise, choose a durable long-term structure and document the decision.

## Data Discovery and Data Use Policy
- Prefer open and FAIR data when possible.
- Prefer streaming or lazy-access workflows over bulk downloads when feasible.
- Use standards-based discovery systems (for example STAC) when relevant.
- When relevant, consider streaming-friendly tooling such as xarray, zarr, GDAL, rasterio, pystac-client, stackstac, gdalcubes, terra, stars, cubo, or equivalent tools.
- When introducing data, document source, access method, format, license, and citation requirements.
- Do not silently ingest external data into the project.

## Data Sovereignty and Intellectual Property Policy
- Consider licensing, copyright, privacy, Indigenous data sovereignty, and related restrictions for all data and content.
- If rights or permissions are unclear, document uncertainty and avoid assuming open reuse.

## Design and Usability Policy
- Keep the website simple, readable, and easy to extend by default.
- When design improvements are requested, prioritize system-level improvements (layout, spacing, typography, hierarchy, navigation, consistency).
- Do not use scattered one-off styling hacks.
- If direct site inspection is possible, verify readability, navigation, link integrity, and that docs still reflect repository state.

## Decision Logging
- Reflect meaningful structural, architectural, documentation, data-source, or design decisions in changelog, dev log, roadmap, or equivalent history files when appropriate.
